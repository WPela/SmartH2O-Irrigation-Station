# SIS Project 3
Repository for SmartH2O-Irrigation-Station (SIS) Project_3

Repository contains code, schematics, plans and all versions of SIS. It is based on ESP8266, with soil moisture sensor and water pump.

TBU!!!
List of parts:
 - ESP8266
 - Soil Moisture sensor with integrated water pump and transistor (M5Stack watering Unit with Moisture Sensor and Pump)
 - LD1117V33 voltage stabilizer + 10ÂµF capacitor + 10nF capacitor
 - Power supply (7-12V)

   *additionaly*
   
 - 5.5x2.5mm power connector
 - m5stack Grove connector
 - on/off switch
 - schottky diode min 1A
 - oled ssd1306 screen

Below diagram describes a way of all the connections between ESP8266, sensor and pump. All the components are power with 3,3V via voltage stablilizer.
