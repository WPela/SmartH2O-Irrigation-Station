# SIS Project 2
Repository for SmartH2O-Irrigation-Station (SIS) Project_2

Repository contains code, schematics, plans and all versions of SIS. It is based on Raspberry RP2040 compatible board, with soil moisture sensor and water pump controlled by relay.

Link to repository: https://github.com/WPela/SmartH2O-Irrigation-Station/tree/master/Project_2

List of parts:
 - Waveshare RP2040-Zero (any microcontroller with RP2040 can be used)
 - Soil Moisture sensor with integrated water pump and transistor (M5Stack watering Unit with Moisture Sensor and Pump)
 - LD1117V33 voltage stabilizer + two 100ÂµF capacitors
 - Power supply (7-15V)

Below diagram describes a way of all the connections between RP2040, sensor and pump. All the components are power with 3,3V via voltage stablilizer.
