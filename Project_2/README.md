# SIS Project 2
Repository for SmartH2O-Irrigation-Station (SIS) Project_2

Repository contains code, schematics, plans and all versions of SIS. It is based on Raspberry RP2040 compatible board, with soil moisture sensor and water pump.

List of parts:
 - Waveshare RP2040-Zero (any microcontroller with RP2040 can be used)
 - Soil Moisture sensor with integrated water pump and transistor (M5Stack watering Unit with Moisture Sensor and Pump)
 - LD1117V33 voltage stabilizer + two 100ÂµF capacitors
 - Power supply (7-12V)

   *additionaly*
   
 - 5.5x2.5mm power connector
 - m5stack Grove connector
 - on/off switch
 - schottky diode min 1A
 - oled ssd1306 screen

Below diagram describes a way of all the connections between RP2040, sensor and pump. All the components are power with 3,3V via voltage stablilizer.
